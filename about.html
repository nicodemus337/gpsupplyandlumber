<h1>About Us</h1>
<p class="slogan">“Generations Rooted in Service and Supply”</p>
<p>We’re a Loreauville hardware & lumber yard built on simple promises: stock what pros actually use, answer the phone, quote fast, and stand behind every sale. The goal is straightforward — keep builders building across Iberia and St. Martin Parish.</p>


<h2>Owners</h2>


<h3>Shannon Gonsoulin, DVM — Co‑Owner</h3>
<p>Dr. Shannon (“Doc”) Gonsoulin has been around animals and hard work his entire life. Raised around horses, he entered rodeo competitions to help pay for college, eventually earning his Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree. He and his wife, Toni, built four successful veterinary clinics while raising their four children.</p>
<p>Rooted deeply in Acadiana, Doc descends from Jean Francois de Beaumelle Gonsoulin, who arrived from France in 1770 and registered the historic F2 cattle brand. Inspired by that legacy, he established a grass‑fed beef operation on his family land in Loreauville, continuing a centuries‑long Gonsoulin tradition of stewardship, livestock, and local service.</p>
<p>Today, Doc brings that same grit and pride to GP Supply & Lumber — focused on serving builders, ranchers, and families with the same dedication his family has carried for generations.</p>
