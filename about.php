    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>We’re a continuation of a simple promise: Loreauville will always have a locally owned hardware and lumber store. New name, same mission — stock what the community needs and help you finish the job.</p>
    <p>From everyday fixes to ranch work and renovations, we focus on practical inventory, fair advice, and fast sourcing when something special is required.</p>
