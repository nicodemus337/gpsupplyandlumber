  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Waiver of Liability & Safety Rules</h1>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">
    Our highest priority is the safety of our guests, guides, dogs, and land. All guests must review and sign a liability waiver before participating in any guided hunts or field activities.
    <br>
    We operate in natural, wild terrain with real firearms, live birds, and working dogs. We expect every guest to follow guide instructions, remain alert, and treat the land and animals with care and respect. Please read the waiver carefully before signing. If you have questions, don’t hesitate to <a href="contact.php"> get in touch</a>.
